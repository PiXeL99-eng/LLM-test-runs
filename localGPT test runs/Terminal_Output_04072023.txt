Note: switching to 'v0.2.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

 SUCI stands for Security User Plane Information Context. It contains information about the security configuration of the user plane for a particular IP flow.   

Enter a query: What is Mobile Management Entity?


> Question:
What is Mobile Management Entity?

> Answer:
 The Mobile Management Entity (MME) is a component in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network responsible for managing the mobility of User Equipment (UE). It performs functions such as informing the network of the UE's current location, providing user identity confidentiality, and supporting connection management services to the Session Management (SM) and Short Message Services (SMS) entities of the Connection Management (CM) sublayer.

> Question:
What does GUTI stand for?

> Answer:
 GUTI stands for Generic Universal Third Generation Identifier.

Enter a query: Give the list of forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode.


> Question:
Give the list of forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode.

> Answer:
 The list of forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode is implementation dependent, but it should include the PLMN identity provided with the indication from the lower layers to prepare for an S101 mode to S1 mode handover whenever an ATTACH REJECT message is received with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not allowed", #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking area", #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN", #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area", or #35 "Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN" as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.5.

Enter a query: Describe the EMM DEREGISTERED NORMAL-SERVICE state.


> Question:
Describe the EMM DEREGISTERED NORMAL-SERVICE state.

> Answer:
 The EMM DEREGISTERED NORMAL-SERVICE state is one of the substates of the EMM-DEREGISTERED state. It is reached when a suitable cell with a valid IMSI has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not in the forbidden list. In this state, the UE can perform normal service procedures such as making calls and sending messages.

Enter a query: What is Attach procedure in LTE?


> Question:
What is Attach procedure in LTE?

> Answer:
 The Attach Procedure in LTE is used by a User Equipment (UE) to attach to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) for packet services in EPS. It can be used for EPS services only, for both EPS and non-EPS services, or for SMS only in NB-S1 mode. The purpose of the attachment process is to establish a logical link between the UE and the EPC. The Attach Procedure includes several steps such as the Attach Request, Attachment Failure, Reattach Request, and Reattach Failure.
